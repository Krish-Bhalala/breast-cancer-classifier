# Breast Cancer Prediction Project

## Overview

I've developed a machine learning project to predict breast cancer tumor classification using the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset. This project aims to contribute to the field of medical diagnostics by leveraging data science techniques.

## Project Goals

- Develop a model to classify breast tumors as malignant or benign
- Implement and compare various machine learning algorithms
- Demonstrate practical application of data science in healthcare

## Dataset

I'm using the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset, which includes:
- 569 samples of breast masses
- 30 features describing each tumor's characteristics
- Binary classification: malignant or benign

## Technical Implementation

- Language: R
- Libraries: neuralnet

## Key Steps

1. Data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis
2. Feature scaling and selection
3. Model training and hyperparameter tuning
4. Performance evaluation using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score
5. Model comparison and selection

## How to Use This Project

- Download or clone this repo
- Open it using an IDE supporting jupyter notebook (specifically VS code) with R kernel
- Run all cells

## Results and Evaluation

I've implemented multiple models and evaluated their performance. The README will be updated with specific results as the project progresses.

## Future Work

- Explore deep learning approaches, particularly convolutional neural networks
- Investigate the potential of transfer learning using pre-trained models
